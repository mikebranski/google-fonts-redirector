# Google Fonts Redirector

> This Google Chrome extension ensures you are always viewing the newest version
> of Google Fonts.

# Installation

You can [download it directly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-fonts-redirector/fidipbbihoglcmonjdnfealklijlodae)
from the Chrome Webstore.

If for any reason you do not want to go through the Chrome Webstore, you can
grab the [`.crx` file directly](https://github.com/mikebranski/google-fonts-redirector/blob/master/google-fonts-redirect-chrome-extension.crx), or  [download](https://github.com/mikebranski/google-fonts-redirector/archive/master.zip)
the project from GitHub and [install it pretty easily as an unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked). Just
take note that you will not receive automatic updates this way.

## Why?

Google recently introduced [a super sexy overhaul](https://design.google.com/articles/reimagining-google-fonts/)
for their excellent Fonts platform. This is great, but they don't automatically
redirect you to the new version - even if you already opted to switch on a
previous visit. What this extension does is simply redirect you from
https://www.google.com/fonts to https://fonts.google.com/, preserving the font
you are currently viewing if you are viewing one; otherwise it simply takes you
to the new home page.

## Roadmap Considerations

These are potential _ideas_ for future iterations, but, let's face it, without
people like you telling me you'd like to see these things, I may not actually
put them in. Bonus points if you fork this and add it yourself!

- A better icon, [because lol](https://github.com/mikebranski/google-fonts-redirector/blob/master/icon-19.png).
- Ability to click the extension icon to switch between the new and old version
  for the current tab.
